        <h4>Actual Innocence</h4>

        <p>
            In the context of sealing records in the District of Columbia under D.C. Code &sect; 16-802, this refers
            to one of two situations:
        <ol>
            <li>when the offense for which the person was arrested or charged did not occur;</li>
            <li>and/or when the person did not commit the offense for which she was arrested or charged. Assuming that
                she/he was never convicted for that charge, she/he can attempt to seal her/his arrest and charge record
                anytime without any waiting period. If she/he was convicted, she/he cannot use actual innocence to sea
                records related to her/his conviction.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Acquitted</h4>

        <p>
            A person was found "not guilty" for the crime which he was charged. It is the legal and formal
            certification of the innocence of a person who has been charged with a crime. For example: Mr. Smith
            was arrested and charged for theft. However, Mr. Smith was found "not guilty" and acquitted of his
            theft charge.
        </p>
        <h4>Arrested</h4>

        <p>
            To take or hold a suspected criminal with legal authority, as by a law enforcement officer. An arrest
            may be made legally based on a warrant issued by a court after receiving a sworn statement of probable
            cause to believe there has been a crime committed by this person, for an apparent crime committed in
            the presence of the arresting officer, or upon probable cause to believe a crime has been committed by
            that person. Once the arrest has been made, the officer must give the arrestee his/her rights
            ("Miranda rights") at the first practical moment, and either cite the person to appear in court or
            bring him/her in to jail.
        </p>
        <h4>Case Number</h4>

        <p>
            This is the identification number that the court assigns to each and every case that it handles. In the
            context of sealing criminal records, this number is always necessary for sealing. In rare instances where
            the court does not have a court case number for your arrest or charge, you should request the court to
            assign you a case number.
        </p>
        <h4>Case Pending</h4>

        <p>
            This refers to any case that is pending or has not been fully resolved. For example, if a case does not have
            a case disposition, it is likely a case pending.

        <h4>Completion of the Sentence</h4>

        <p>
            The person has been unconditionally discharged from incarceration, commitment, probation, parole, or
            supervised release, whichever is latest.
        </p>
        <h4>Convicted/Conviction</h4>

        <p>
            It refers to the judgment (sentence) on a verdict or a finding of guilty, a plea of guilty or a plea of
            <em>nolo contendere</em>, or a plea or verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.
        </p>

            Refers to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

        <h4>Deferred sentencing agreement</h4>

        <p>
            Voluntary agreement between the government and a defendant, the defendant agrees to waive his/her right to a
            trial and to plead guilty to the charged offense. However, instead of proceeding directly to sentencing, the
            government provides the defendant with an agreed upon period of time to complete an agreed upon set of
            conditions. If the defendant completes these conditions successfully, the court allows him/her to withdraw
            the guilty plea, and the government will dismiss (<em>nolle prosequi</em>) the charges. This means that the
            defendant does not end up with a conviction on his/her record. If, however, the defendant fails to abide by
            his/her end of the agreement, the court will enter the guilty plea into the record and sentence him/her
            accordingly.
