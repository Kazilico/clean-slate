                <p>
                    This is a resource to assist users in determining IF and WHEN an arrest, charge or conviction
                    on a D.C. criminal record MAY be eligible for sealing or for fixing errors on your record.

                    Are you looking to expunge your record? Please note that the District of Columbia does not allow for expunging a record; the options that are available include 1) the ability to seal a record, 2) dispute an error on a record, 3) or prove that you are innocent of something that appears on your record and thus want it completely removed. 

                    More information on the benefits of sealing or correcting your record can be found when you
                    click on the FAQs section in the menu in the right hand upper corner of this site.
